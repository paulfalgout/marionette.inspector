## Logging

Local logging can be turned on easily by enabling the two logger classes (`debug`, `logger`)

https://github.com/MarionetteLabs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/extension/js/common/util/Logger.js#L14
https://github.com/MarionetteLabs/marionette.inspector/blob/master/extension/js/common/util/debug.js#L4

**debug** is the window `agent` logger
**logger** is the inspector logger

## agent

### Testing locally

A good way to test the agent is to run it locally in the `index.html` of the
app you want to inspect.

```html
<script src="http://localhost:4001/build/src/localAgent.js"></script>
````

```bash
cd extension/js/agent
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4001
```

Including the `localAgent` directly this way, is easier than
debugging the `agent` when it's injected into the window via the extension.
